# E-Commerce-Funnel-Analysis
This project analyzes an eCommerce user funnel from Product View → Add to Cart → Begin Checkout → Purchase using Databricks, PySpark, and Delta Lake. It ingests raw clickstream + transaction events, builds sessionized journeys, computes conversion metrics, and produces actionable insights on where users drop off and why.
